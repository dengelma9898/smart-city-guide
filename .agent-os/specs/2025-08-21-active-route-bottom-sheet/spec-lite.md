# Spec Summary (Lite)

Enhance the existing Active Route Bottom Sheet with comprehensive POI management capabilities using native iOS list swipe gestures. Users can swipe left on POIs to access Edit/Delete context menus, replace POIs with cached alternatives, add new POIs via the existing "Stopp hinzuf√ºgen" button, and manually trigger route optimization to avoid rate limiting issues while maintaining flexible route customization.
