## Implementation Status Summary

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED TASKS:**
- **Task 1**: ProfileSettings Integration f√ºr POI-Notification-Kontrolle (100% complete)
- **Task 2**: ProximityService Settings-Integration und Enhancement (100% complete)
- **Task 3**: Route-Completion-Notification (75% complete - notifications work, app navigation pending)

### üîÑ **PARTIALLY COMPLETED:**
- **Task 4**: RouteCompletionStats model ‚úÖ implemented, but RouteSuccessView UI missing
- **Task 3**: Notification handling works, but enhanced app navigation missing

### ‚ùå **TODO TASKS:**
- **Task 3.4-3.7**: Enhanced notification handling for app opening and navigation
- **Task 4.3-4.7**: RouteSuccessView UI implementation and integration
- **Task 5**: Map-Focus Enhancement (not yet started)

### üöÄ **CURRENT FUNCTIONAL STATUS:**
- ‚úÖ POI notifications trigger when approaching waypoints
- ‚úÖ POI notifications can be disabled/enabled in settings
- ‚úÖ Route completion notifications trigger when all spots visited
- ‚úÖ Notifications contain rich metadata for future navigation
- ‚ùå Notification taps don't yet open specific app views
- ‚ùå No RouteSuccessView shown after completion
