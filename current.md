I've completed the comprehensive RouteOptimization.md documentation analyzing our
  current route generation system. Based on the research and analysis, I can now
  provide you with the Apple MapKit route generation parameters that were requested.

  Apple MapKit Route Generation Parameters

  From the research, here are the key parameters available for MKDirections.Request:

  Required Parameters

  - source - MKMapItem starting location
  - destination - MKMapItem ending location

  Transportation Types

  - transportType - .automobile (current), .walking, .transit, .cycling (coming iOS
  2025)

  Route Optimization Parameters

  - requestsAlternateRoutes - Bool to get multiple route options
  - departureDate - Date for traffic-optimized routing
  - arrivalDate - Date for reverse time-based planning

  Current Implementation Status

  Our Smart City Guide currently only uses the basic required parameters
  (source/destination) with .automobile transport type. We're missing opportunities
  for:

  1. Alternative Routes - Could provide users with multiple route options
  2. Time-Based Optimization - Better traffic routing using departure/arrival times
  3. Multi-Modal Transport - Walking routes for short distances, cycling when
  available
  4. Transit Integration - Public transport options in supported cities

  Next Steps for Enhancement

  Based on this research, we could enhance our RouteService to:
  - Use requestsAlternateRoutes = true for route variety
  - Add departure time optimization for traffic avoidance
  - Implement walking routes for short distances (â‰¤2km)
  - Prepare for cycling routes when iOS 2025 releases

  The RouteOptimization.md document provides the complete technical analysis and
  implementation roadmap for transforming our current basic routing into an
  intelligent route generation system.
